the image denoising neural network model has proven to be incredibly successful in reducing noise and improving picture quality. The model considerably decreases noise levels after extensive training, according to key findings, producing cleaner and more aesthetically appealing photos. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are two quantitative metrics that consistently show how well the model removes noise. High PSNR values indicate little information loss, and high SSIM values highlight structural similarity to clean images.
Results:
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): 30.19 dB
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM): 0.29
